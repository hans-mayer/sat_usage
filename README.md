### graph to show available satellites over 24 hours 

for UNIX like systems

ksh scripts using gawk, gnuplot and gnuplot-x11

##  sat_usage_ksh

    show number of satellites as graph - v 2016 02 06
    usage: /opt/iiasa/bin/sat_usage_ksh [ -c COUNT ] [ -f IMG ] FILE
       COUNT >= 1
       -f IMG      - output to file - IMG can be jpeg, png, ...

### examples

#### sat_usage_ksh -c 32 -f png  /var/adm/nmea_2016_096_log

![](img/plot_2016096_c32.png)

the image above shows in the first line f the header name and IP address of the host running this script. next one can see the name of the log-file and the value of argument '-c'. this is the number of entries taken for an average calculation. <br> 
in the second one can see the minimum was 5 satellites for a period of 110 seconds and maximum 17 satellites for a period of 20 seconds. the average number of satellites is 8.4 

below one can see the statistics for the same day but without option '-c'. therefore the counter is 1 and you can see for each second one marker. but a value of 32 gives in most cases better results as above. 

#### sat_usage_ksh -f png  /var/adm/nmea_2016_096_log

##  nmea_log_ksh 

this script reads the via "gpspipe" the gps information generated by "gpsd" and generates a file "/var/adm/nmea_YYYY_DDD_log". this file has 3 colums: timestamp1 timestamp2 number_of_satellites <br>
timestamp1 has format HHMMSS, timestamp2 are the seconds of the day 

##  cron job 

once at 00:00 UTC this script "nmea_log_ksh" should be terminated and a new one should be started. this script is very simple.

    pkill gpspipe
    nmea_log_ksh &

to execute a script at 00:00 UTC i run the following at midnight

<pre>
TIMEDIFF=`date '+%z' | awk '{ print ( $1 / 100 ) }'`
at now + $TIMEDIFF hours 2> /dev/null << foe
new_nmea_ksh
# do some other scripts, for example create an image file and send per e-mail 
foe
</pre>
